Craft is the intricate details. Craft is the hours of both practice and execution. Craft is the persuit of perfection while knowing it doesn't exist. Craft is care. Craft isn't hurry. It is both short-term impression and long-term satisfaction. Sometimes it's minutia and others it's big-picture. It is the tools and how to use and care for them.

It can't be summed up and it can't be realized until experienced. You know it when you see it, though. That is craft.
